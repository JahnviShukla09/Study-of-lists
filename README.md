# Experiment 3: Data Manipulation using Python Lists

## 1. Aim
To explore and implement various operations on Python Lists, including indexing, slicing, modification, and the use of built-in functions for data analysis and real-world tracking applications.

## 2. Theory
A **List** is one of the most versatile data structures in Python. It is a collection which is **ordered**, **mutable** (changeable), and allows **duplicate members**.

### Key Concepts:
* **Indexing:** Accessing a single element. Python uses zero-based indexing. Negative indexing (e.g., `-1`) allows access from the end of the list.
* **Slicing:** Accessing a range of elements using the syntax `[start:stop:step]`.
* **Mutablity:** Unlike strings, lists can be altered in place (e.g., `list[0] = "new_value"`).
* **Methods:** * `.append()`: Adds an item to the end.
    * `.extend()`: Appends elements from another iterable.
    * `.remove()`: Removes the first occurrence of a value.
* **Built-in Functions:** `len()` for size, `max()`/`min()` for limits, and `sum()` for totals.

## 3. Steps / Procedure
1.  **Creation:** Define lists containing different data types (Strings, Integers, Booleans, Complex numbers).
2.  **Accessing Elements:** Practice positive and negative indexing to retrieve specific values.
3.  **Slicing Techniques:** Extract sub-sections of lists using various range parameters
